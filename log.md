# 100 Days Of Code (Kotlin) - Log


### Day 1: Jun 8, 2019 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished chapters 5 and 6 of Head First Kotlin.  These two chapters dealt with inheritance and polymorphism.  I created a project with an abstract class, a super class and various subclasses. 

**Thoughts:** 

I'm still getting used to the differences between Kotlin and Java. In Java, classes are open by default. In Kotlin, you have to declare a class open by using the open keyword.
